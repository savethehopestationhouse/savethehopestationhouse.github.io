				<h2>Station House Historical Events</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>In 1916</strong> a year after the Canadian Northern
					Railway completed its transcontinental line from Vancouver to Montreal, the Hope Station House
					was built at the junction of Hudson's Bay Street and Fifth Avenue at a cost of $7,250.
					<br />
					<strong>In 1942</strong> the Hope Station House was the first stop for many of the 22,000
					Japanese Canadians who were unjustly and forcibly removed from the west coast of British Columbia.
					Nearly 8,000 of these citizens stepped foot on the platform as the Hope CNR Station as it was the
					connector to the rest of the province and internment sites (<strong>Source:</strong> <a
						href="https://nikkeiplace.org/">Nikkei National Museum & Cultural Center</a>)
					<br />
					<strong>In the 1950s</strong> the Station House was graced by royalty: during a
					royal tour across Canada by train, Queen Elizabeth stopped in Hope to greet residents.  Photo Source: Walter Inouye.
					<br />
					<strong>In the 1980s</strong> CN Rail slated the Station House for demolition. The community rallied
					together in a Hurculean effort to raise funds to move it.
					They bought the Station House from CN Rail for $1 and moved the Station House to its current home.
					For the next decade, it served as an arts and cultural center to the community.
					<br />
					<strong>In the late 1990s and 2000s</strong> the Station House once again opened its doors to the community
					and became a hub for musicians. The Hope Station House Community Arts and Heritage Society hosted dinners with
					entertainment provided by local musicians.
					<br />
					<strong>In 2015</strong> stewardship of the Station House was <a
						href="transfer_from_society_to_district_2015.html" target="_new">transferred from the Hope Station House
						Community Arts and Heritage Society
						to the District of Hope under a good faith agreement</a> that the District would preserve the building and
					celebrate
					its legacy in all future decisions regarding its management and/or development.
					<br />

		<h2>Investing in our Future</h2>

		<strong>Investing in the preservation, rehabilitation and ongoing use of heritage buildings</strong>, such as the
		Station House, has a <strong>proven track record of creating economic benefits for BC communities</strong>.
		<br />
		Towns such as
		Nelson, Fort Langley, and Agassiz, each boasting historic train stations as a central feature of their downtown
		core,
		have a thriving tourism industry based on their preserved history. Heritage conservation enriches the urban fabric
		of a town and attracts tourists and locals alike,
		<strong>generating jobs and leading to economic growth.</strong>
		<br />
		There is federal and provincial grant money available that could be used to restore the Station House.
		It need not be a burden borne by taxpayers. In fact, Boston Bar was
		<a href="https://www.hopestandard.com/news/millions-secured-to-restore-boston-bars-historic-1914-station-house/">
			awarded $1.9 million in combined federal and provincial grant money</a> this past summer through
		<a
			href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/canada-and-british-columbia-invest-in-infrastructure-in-the-lower-mainland-to-create-jobs-and-strengthen-communities-892581437.html">
			Infrastructure Canada's Rural and Northern Communities Infrastructure Stream (RNIS)</strong></a> to completely
		restore their Station House.

		Originally built in 1914, once renovated it will “showcase the unique railway and cultural heritage."

				<h2>Current Events</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>March 1, 2021:</strong> the Coalition for the Preservation of the Hope Station House (CPHSH) filed a formal complaint with the BC Ombudsperson (file #21-187813) regarding the
					process used by the District of Hope in their decision to demolish it; we felt due process was not taken.
					<br />
					<strong>March 5, 2021:</strong> the BC Ombudsperson contacted the CPHSH to inform us that they had officially opened an
					investigation regarding our complaint.
					<br />
					<strong>March 13, 2021:</strong> the BC Ombudsperson contacted the CPHSH to let us know they had requested that the
					District of Hope halt demolition work for a period of one week, from March 15, 2021 to March 22, 2021.
					<br />
					<strong>March 19, 2021:</strong> legal counsel for the CPHSH delivered a legal letter to the District of Hope, owners of the Station House
					building, requesting an temporary and immediate stay of demolition.
					<br />
					<strong>March 25, 2021:</strong> legal counsel for the CPHSH filed an application with the Minister of Forests,
					Lands and Natural Resource Operation requesting a Stop Work Order; under Section 16 of the Heritage Conservation Act, the Minister can issue
					these orders for a period of up to 120 days.
					<br />
					<strong>March 29, 2021:</strong> the District of Hope took the fence surrounding the Station House down for "safety
					reasons."
					<br />
					<strong>April 12, 2021:</strong> the Director of the Heritage Branch on behalf of the Minister of Forests, Lands
					and Natural Resource Operation issued a 120-day Stop Work Order ordering "the District of Hope, its contractors,
					subcontractors, employees and agents, and anyone having notice of this Order immediately stop any work in progress
					and make no alteration (including demolition) of the Hope Station Building.
					<br />
					<strong>April 12, 2021:</strong> the BC Ombudsperson completed their review of our complaint and sent us a report
					of their findings.  One of the more relevant takeaways from that report is "concerns about the Council’s omission of any consideration
					of the impact of the Station House’s potential heritage status at the time Council voted to demolish the building.”
					<br />
					<strong>April 12, 2021:</strong> the District of Hope Council has proposed a new bylaw, Bylaw 1502, to repeal
					By-law 633 which was passed in 1982 to protect the Station House as a heritage site. In their Regular Meeting on April 12th, the
					District Council made two of the required three readings, prior to their final vote, to pass the bylaw. The
					Coalition for the Preservation of the Hope Station House presented a delegation providing our arguments against the
					new bylaw. A public hearing will be held on May 10, 2021 prior to the Council's final reading and vote, the date of
					which is to be determined.
