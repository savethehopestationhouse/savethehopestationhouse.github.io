				<h2>Protecting our History and our Heritage</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>In 1916</strong>, a year after the Canadian Northern
					Railway completed its transcontinental line from Vancouver to Montreal, the Hope Station House
					was built at the junction of Hudson's Bay Street and Fifth Avenue at a cost of $7,250. 
					<br />
					<strong>In the 1950s</strong>, the Station House was graced by royalty: during a
					royal tour across Canada by train, Queen Elizabeth stopped in Hope to greet residents.
				<br />
					<strong>In the 1980s</strong> CN Rail slated the Station House for demolition.  The community rallied 
					together in a Hurculean effort to raise funds to move it. 
					They bought the Station House from CN Rail for $1 and moved the Station House to its current home.
					For the next decade, it served as an arts and cultural center to the community.
				<br />
					<strong>In the late 1990s and 2000s</strong>, the Station House once again opened its doors to the community
							and became a hub for musicians.  The Hope Station House Community Arts and Heritage Society hosted dinners with 
							entertainment provided by local musicians.

				<h2>Investing in our Future</h2>

				<strong>Investing in the preservation, rehabilitation and ongoing use of heritage buildings</strong>, such as the
				 Station House, has a <strong>proven track record of creating economic benefits for BC communities</strong>.
				<br />
				 Towns such as
					Nelson, Fort Langley, and Agassiz, each boasting historic train stations as a central feature of their downtown core, 
					have a thriving tourism industry based on their preserved history.  Heritage conservation enriches the urban fabric of a town and attracts tourists and locals alike,
					<strong>generating jobs and leading to economic growth.</strong>
					<br />
					There is federal and provincial grant money available that could be used to restore the Station House.  
					It need not be a burden borne by taxpayers.  In fact, Boston Bar was
						<a href="https://www.hopestandard.com/news/millions-secured-to-restore-boston-bars-historic-1914-station-house/">
						awarded $1.9 million in combined federal and provincial grant money</a> this past summer through 
							<a
								href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/canada-and-british-columbia-invest-in-infrastructure-in-the-lower-mainland-to-create-jobs-and-strengthen-communities-892581437.html">
								Infrastructure Canada's Rural and Northern Communities Infrastructure Stream (RNIS)</strong></a> to completely restore their Station House. 
						
						Originally built in 1914, once renovated it will â€œshowcase the unique railway and cultural heritage."
						<!-- The main floor will house an educational center and artisan area, and the basement a railroad history exhibition.
					  -->
<!-- 
					 Train station in Fort Langley, also constructed in 1915, was moved a hundred feet east from its original location in 1983.

				<h2>How did we get Here?</h2>
			<strong>The District of
						Hope's Council passed a motion agreeing to destroy this century-old building</strong> <a
							href="https://www.hopestandard.com/news/hopes-historic-station-house-coming-down-in-2021/"> in a settlement of
							$650,000
						with the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure.</a>  Due to an error apparently made by MOTI, 
						<a href="https://www.hopestandard.com/news/ministry-fumbled-the-ball-on-station-house-hope-mayor/">
						the offer of sale of the land to the Distrct was rescinded</a>.
				<br />
						While the Mayor has defended Council's decision and pointed to the agreement with MOTI as the reason for demolition, 
						ignoring growing public outcry, it is still unclear whether there is a legal obligation given conflicting reports. 
						Similarly, the accuracy of <a
							href="https://www.hopestandard.com/news/district-settles-with-province-for-650000-ownership-of-station-house-transfers/">Mayor
							Robb's claims that "the building doesn't qualify for heritage status, as it as been moved from its original location</a>" 
							isn't clear as, apparently, moving a heritage building technically shouldn't render its previous heritage designation in 
							1982 under By-Law No. 633 null and void.
