				<h1>Save the Hope Station House</h1>
				<p class="major">The Hope Station House, built in 1916, is an integral part of the history of Hope, BC.
				Tragically, <strong>we are at serious risk of losing this important part of our heritage</strong>. The District of
				Hope's Council plans on putting out an RFP before January 22, 2021 to obtain quotes to demolish this historic building.  
				While time is running out, it's still not too late to do something.  
				<br/><br/>
				<strong>Please read on to learn how you 
				can join us in raising your voice to save this important part of Hope's and the Fraser Valley's history!</strong>

				<h2>Protecting our History and our Heritage</h2>
				<p>
					In 1915, the Canadian Northern Railway completed its transcontinental line from Vancouver to Montreal providing
					an important transportation artery connecting the entire country. Just one year later the station house in Hope, BC
					was built at the junction of Hudson's Bay Street and Fifth Avenue at a cost of $7,250 by the Great Northern Railway. 
					The Hope CNR Station was a hub of activity, dropping off and picking up passengers traveling the Vancouver-Victoria
					Eastern and Great Northern Railoads.  In the 1950s, the Hope Station was even graced by royalty: during a
					royal tour across Canada by train, Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh stopped in Hope to greet 
					the residents of Hope.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Hope Station stood empty from the 1960s until the 1980s when CN Rail slated it for demolition if it wasn't moved
					to another location.  After the community rallied together in a Hurculean fundraising effort under the leadership of 
					Fran Simpson, the Hope Station House was bought for a $1 from CN Rail and was moved to its current home at the junction 
					of the Old Hope Princeton Way and Water Avenue, presenting visitors with their first glipmse of the town of Hope.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the 1980s, it was a hub for the arts community and a center of culture in Hope.  The first floor was converted into a restaurant
					that was open for breakfast and lunch.  It was a popular spot with locals.  The downstairs floor of the Station House 
					housed potters' wheels, painters' easels, and had rehearsal space for the local Hope Theatre Group.

				<h2>Investing in our Future</h2>
				<p>Investing in the preservation, rehabilitation and ongoing use of heritage buildings such as the Hope Station
					House has a <strong>proven track record of creating economic benefits for BC communities</strong>. Towns such as
					Nelson, Fort Langley, and Agassiz each boasting historic train stations as a central feature of their downtown core, 
					have a thriving tourism industry based on their preserved history.</p>

					<p>Heritage conservation enriches the urban fabric of a town and attracts tourists and locals alike,
					<strong>generating jobs and leading to economic growth.</strong></p>

					<p>Boston Bar, with a fraction of the population of Hope and just 20 minutes down the CN line,
						<a href="https://www.hopestandard.com/news/millions-secured-to-restore-boston-bars-historic-1914-station-house/">was
						recently awarded $1.9 million in funding</a> to completely restore their train station which was built in 1914,
						just two years before the Hope Station House was built.  In a similar state as the Hope Station House, it also 
						
						The station house will become a rest stop and museum “to showcase the unique railway and cultural heritage” a
						Government of Canada news release stated. On the main floor, an educational gathering place and artisan area will
						exist, as well as a coffee shop. The basement will appeal to fans of railroad history, as well as possibly fans of
						the paranormal.
					 </p>

					 Train station in Fort Langley, also constructed in 1915, was moved a hundred feet east from its original location in 1983.

				<h2>How did we get Here?</h2>
				<p>The District of Hope's Council passed a motion agreeing to destroy this century-old building in a settlement of $650,000
					with the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (
					<a href="https://www.hopestandard.com/news/hopes-historic-station-house-coming-down-in-2021/">Source </a>).

					According to Mayor Peter Robb in an
					<a href="https://www.hopestandard.com/news/ministry-fumbled-the-ball-on-station-house-hope-mayor/">article published
						in the Hope Standard</a>, the Ministry failed to undertake consultation
						with First Nations.  Because of their error, the Ministry was forced to rescind
						their offer of sale of the land upon which the Hope Station House sits to the District of Hope.
						Instead the two bodies entered into negotiations ending in the aforementioned settlement.
				</p>
				<p>
						It is important to point out that the District of Hope is	apparently not being forced by the Ministry as part of their
						agreement to destroy the Hope Station.  As our elected representatives, if it is our will that the Hope Station 
						be saved from demolition, it is at their discretion to pay heed.

						While the Mayor has defended the Council's decision by stating that "the building doesn't qualify for heritage
						status, as it as been move from its original location", an as yet unverified statement, it is important to point out
						that the 1914 CN station in Boston Bar was moved from its original location as was the 1915 CN station in Fort Langley.

				<h2>What Can You Do RIGHT NOW?</h2>
				<p>The most important thing we can do right now is to inform our elected officials - the Mayor and Councilmembers of the 
					District of Hope - as well as our MLA and the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure know loudly and clearly
					that we were not consulted and we will not pay the price for their negligence with the loss of our heritage.
