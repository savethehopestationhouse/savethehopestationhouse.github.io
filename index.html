				<h1>Save the Hope Station House</h1>
				<p class="major">The Hope Station House, built in 1916, is an integral part of the history of Hope, BC.
				Tragically, <strong>we are at serious risk of losing this important part of our heritage</strong>. The District of
				Hope's Council plans on putting out an RFP for quotes to demolish this historic building before January 22, 2021.  
				While time is running out, it's still not too late to do something.  
				<br/><br/>
				<strong>Please read on to learn how you 
				can join us in raising your voice to save this important part of Hope's and the Fraser Valley's history!</strong>

				<h2>Protecting our History and our Heritage</h2>
				<p>
					In 1915, the Canadian Northern Railway completed its transcontinental line from Vancouver to Montreal providing
					an important transportation artery connecting the entire country. Just one year later the station house in Hope, BC
					was built.  Its original location was at X.</p>

				<h2>Investing in our Future</h2>
				<p>Investing in the preservation, rehabilitation and ongoing use of heritage buildings such as the Hope Station
					House has a <strong>proven track record of creating economic benefits for BC communities</strong>. Towns such as
					Nelson, Fort Langley, and Agassiz each boasting historic train stations as a central feature of their downtown core, 
					have a thriving tourism industry based on their preserved history.</p>

					<p>Heritage conservation enriches the urban fabric of a town and attracts tourists and locals alike,
					<strong>generating jobs and leading to economic growth.</strong></p>

				<h2>How did we get Here?</h2>
				<p>The District of Hope's Council passed a motion to destroy this century-old building in a settlement of $650,000
					with the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (
					<ahref="https://www.hopestandard.com/news/hopes-historic-station-house-coming-down-in-2021/">Source </ahref>).

					According to Mayor Peter Robb in an
					<ahref="https://www.hopestandard.com/news/ministry-fumbled-the-ball-on-station-house-hope-mayor/">article published
						in the Hope Standard</ahref>, the Ministry of Transportation failed to undertake consultation
						with First Nations.  Because of their error, the Ministry of Transportation was forced to rescind
						their offer of sale to the District of Hope, of the land upon which the Hope Station House sits.
						Instead they entered into negotiations with Hope and negotiated a settlement of $650,000.

						The District of Hope, however, is not being forced by the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure to 
						destroy the Hope Station.  As our elected representatives, if it is our will that the Hope Station be saved
						from demolition, it is at their discretion to pay heed.

				<h2>What Can You Do RIGHT NOW?</h2>
				<p>The most important thing we can do right now is to inform our elected officials - the Mayor and Councilmembers of the 
					District of Hope - as well as our MLA and the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure know loudly and clearly
					that we were not consulted and we will not pay the price for their negligence with the loss of our heritage.
