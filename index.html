				<h1>Save the Hope Station House</h1>
				<p class="major">The Hope Station House, built in 1916, is an integral part of the history of Hope, BC.
				It was formally <strong>"declared [...] a heritage building in July 1982" (The Hope Standard, March 28, 2984)</strong> by the
					sitting Hope Council, led by Mayor Bud Gardner.
				Tragically, today almost 40 years later, <strong>we are at serious risk of losing this important part of our heritage.</strong> 
				<br/>
				The District of Hope put out an <a
					href="http://www.civicinfo.bc.ca/bids?bidid=8201">RFP on January 14, 2021</a> to obtain quotes
					to demolish this historic building.  It closes on February 12, 2021.  The proposed date of demolition has not been announced,
					but it'll likely be close to the end of February or early March 2021.
				While time is running out, it's still not too late to do something.  
				<br/>
				<strong>Please read on to learn how you 
				can join us in raising your voice to save this important part of Hope's and the Fraser Valley's history!</strong>

				<h2>Protecting our History and our Heritage</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>In 1916</strong>, a year after the Canadian Northern
					Railway completed its transcontinental line from Vancouver to Montreal, the station house in Hope, BC
					was built at the junction of Hudson's Bay Street and Fifth Avenue at a cost of $7,250. 
					The Hope CNR Station was a hub of activity.  
					<br />
					<strong>In the 1950s</strong>, the Hope Station was graced by royalty: during a
					royal tour across Canada by train, Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh stopped in Hope to greet 
					the residents of Hope.
				<br />
					<strong>In the 1980s</strong> CN Rail slated the Hope Station House for demolition if it wasn't moved
					to another location.  The community rallied together in a Hurculean fundraising effort to raise funds for the move. 
					The Station House was bought from CN Rail for a $1 and moved to its current home at the junction 
					of the Old Hope Princeton Way and Water Avenue.
					For the next decade, it served as an arts and culture hub for the community. The first floor
					was converted into a tea house, and the bottom floor housed potters' wheels, painters' easels, and a rehearsal space for the local Hope Theatre Group.
				<br />
					<strong>In the late 1990s and 2000s</strong>, the Hope Station House once again opened its doors to the community
							and became a hub for musicians.  The Hope Station House Community Arts and Heritage Society hosted dinners with 
							old time musical entertainment provided by local musicians.

				<h2>Investing in our Future</h2>
				<o>
				<strong>Investing in the preservation, rehabilitation and ongoing use of heritage buildings</strong> such as the
				Hope Station
					House has a <strong>proven track record of creating economic benefits for BC communities</strong>.
						Towns such as
					Nelson, Fort Langley, and Agassiz, each boasting historic train stations as a central feature of their downtown core, 
					have a thriving tourism industry based on their preserved history.  Heritage conservation enriches the urban fabric of a town and attracts tourists and locals alike,
					<strong>generating jobs and leading to economic growth.</strong>
					<br />
					Boston Bar, with a fraction of the population of Hope and just 45 minutes down the CN line,
						<a href="https://www.hopestandard.com/news/millions-secured-to-restore-boston-bars-historic-1914-station-house/">was
						<strong>recently awarded $1.9 million in combined federal and provincial grant money</strong></a> to completely
						restore their Station House. Built in 1914, just two years
						before the Hope Station House, it is in a similar condition.  
						
						The renovated station house slated to open in the next few years will “showcase the unique railway and cultural heritage” a Government of Canada news release stated. 
						The main floor will house an educational center, an artisan area, and a coffee shop. The basement will feature 
						a railroad history exhibition.
					 
<!-- 
					 Train station in Fort Langley, also constructed in 1915, was moved a hundred feet east from its original location in 1983.

				<h2>How did we get Here?</h2>
			<strong>The District of
						Hope's Council passed a motion agreeing to destroy this century-old building</strong> <a
							href="https://www.hopestandard.com/news/hopes-historic-station-house-coming-down-in-2021/"> in a settlement of
							$650,000
						with the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure.</a>  Due to an error apparently made by the Ministry, 
						<a href="https://www.hopestandard.com/news/ministry-fumbled-the-ball-on-station-house-hope-mayor/">
						they rescinded
						their offer of sale of the land</a> upon which the Hope Station House sits, to the District of Hope.
				<br />
						<strong>As well, it is important to point out that the District of Hope is apparently not being forced by the Ministry 
							to destroy the Station House as part of their agreement.</strong> As our elected representatives, if it is our collective 
							will that the Station House be saved from demolition, it is their job to listen to our concerns and take action.

						<a href="https://www.hopestandard.com/news/district-settles-with-province-for-650000-ownership-of-station-house-transfers/"></a>
						While the Mayor has defended the Council's decision by stating that "the building doesn't qualify for heritage
						status, as it as been move from its original location"</a>, it is important to point out that
						<a
							href="https://www.hopestandard.com/news/millions-secured-to-restore-boston-bars-historic-1914-station-house/"> the
							1914 CN station in Boston Bar was moved in 1994 from its original location</a> as was the 1915 CN station in Fort
							Langley.

				<h2><div id="how_to_help">What Can You Do RIGHT NOW?</div></h2>
				<p>The most important thing you can do right now is to loudly and clearly inform our elected officials - the members of the District of Hope Council, 
					our MLA - as well as the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure that it is our will to SAVE THE HOPE STATION HOUSE!  
				</p>
				<h3>Sign the Petition</h3>
				<p>
					As a first step, you can sign the <a
						href=" https://community.sumofus.org/petition/cc475db9-c2ce-46d3-bb51-5a25cc559820?target=%22_blank%22">petition
						created by Christian
						and Erica Ward</a>.
				</p>

				<h3>Write a Letter/Email</h3>
				<p>
				Writing a letter is an even more effective tool, particularly when it's personalised.
				<br/>
				<strong>COMING SOON: sample letters you can copy+paste and edit.</strong>
			  </p>

				<h3>Make a Call</h3>
				<p>
					Another option is to call up the members of your Council.  This requires more work, but like a letter it can be more 
					effective as, in general the more time it takes you to do it, the more seriously it will be taken.</p>

				<h3>Attend a (Virtual) Council Meeting</h3>
				<div>
					Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, Council Meetings are closed to the public: 
					however, the public can email questions and/or comments to the Director of Corporate Services,
