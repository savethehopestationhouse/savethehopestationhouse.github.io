				<h2>Station House Historical Events</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>In 1916</strong> a year after the Canadian Northern
					Railway completed its transcontinental line from Vancouver to Montreal, the Hope Station House
					was built at the junction of Hudson's Bay Street and Fifth Avenue at a cost of $7,250.
					<br />
					<strong>In 1942</strong> the Hope Station House was the first stop for many of the 22,000
					Japanese Canadians who were unjustly and forcibly removed from the west coast of British Columbia.
					Nearly 8,000 of these citizens stepped foot on the platform as the Hope CNR Station as it was the
					connector to the rest of the province and internment sites (<strong>Source:</strong> <a
						href="https://nikkeiplace.org/">Nikkei National Museum & Cultural Center</a>)
					<br />
					<strong>In the 1950s</strong> the Station House was graced by royalty: during a
					royal tour across Canada by train, Queen Elizabeth stopped in Hope to greet residents.  Photo Source: Walter Inouye.
					<br />
					<strong>In the 1980s</strong> CN Rail slated the Station House for demolition. The community rallied
					together in a Hurculean effort to raise funds to move it.
					They bought the Station House from CN Rail for $1 and moved the Station House to its current home.
					For the next decade, it served as an arts and cultural center to the community.
					<br />
					<strong>In the late 1990s and 2000s</strong> the Station House once again opened its doors to the community
					and became a hub for musicians. The Hope Station House Community Arts and Heritage Society hosted dinners with
					entertainment provided by local musicians.
					<br />
					<strong>In 2015</strong> stewardship of the Station House was <a
						href="transfer_from_society_to_district_2015.html" target="_new">transferred from the Hope Station House
						Community Arts and Heritage Society
						to the District of Hope under a good faith agreement</a> that the District would preserve the building and
					celebrate
					its legacy in all future decisions regarding its management and/or development.
					<br />

		<h2>Investing in our Future</h2>

		<strong>Investing in the preservation, rehabilitation and ongoing use of heritage buildings</strong>, such as the
		Station House, has a <strong>proven track record of creating economic benefits for BC communities</strong>.
		<br />
		Towns such as
		Nelson, Fort Langley, and Agassiz, each boasting historic train stations as a central feature of their downtown
		core,
		have a thriving tourism industry based on their preserved history. Heritage conservation enriches the urban fabric
		of a town and attracts tourists and locals alike,
		<strong>generating jobs and leading to economic growth.</strong>
		<br />
		There is federal and provincial grant money available that could be used to restore the Station House.
		It need not be a burden borne by taxpayers. In fact, Boston Bar was
		<a href="https://www.hopestandard.com/news/millions-secured-to-restore-boston-bars-historic-1914-station-house/">
			awarded $1.9 million in combined federal and provincial grant money</a> this past summer through
		<a
			href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/canada-and-british-columbia-invest-in-infrastructure-in-the-lower-mainland-to-create-jobs-and-strengthen-communities-892581437.html">
			Infrastructure Canada's Rural and Northern Communities Infrastructure Stream (RNIS)</strong></a> to completely
		restore their Station House.

		Originally built in 1914, once renovated it will “showcase the unique railway and cultural heritage."
